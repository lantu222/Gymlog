/**
 * Recreates the home-screen widget family's native side on every
 * `expo prebuild`.
 *
 * android/ is gitignored in this repo, so every file the widgets need is
 * written from here: four provider metadata files, four layouts, four picker
 * previews, the drawables, two string tables, the Kotlin providers and the
 * manifest receivers.
 *
 * The widgets read a JSON file the app writes (see src/utils/homeWidget.ts).
 * That is the entire data bridge — no broadcast, no shared preferences. In
 * exchange they refresh on Android's own schedule, whose floor is 30 minutes.
 *
 * Everything drawn is a finished string. No dates are formatted and nothing is
 * translated here, because a launcher process has none of the app's context and
 * this is the worst possible place to rediscover that. The exception is the
 * copy for states where no payload exists yet: those live in strings.xml, get
 * translated by the system locale, and are the only words the widget owns.
 *
 * THEMING. The widget cannot read `src/theming.ts` — it is drawn by the
 * launcher, in another process, from RemoteViews. So both palettes are written
 * out as drawables and colour literals below, and the payload carries the
 * *resolved* theme name. The tables below name their source so the two can be
 * diffed by eye.
 *
 * THE FAMILY. Four receivers, because the widget picker lists receivers and a
 * size nobody can find is a size nobody uses:
 *
 *   WeekWidgetProvider     2×2  "Month"    the month, and nothing else
 *   HomeWidgetProvider     4×2  "Month +"  the month, with this month's figures
 *   StreakWidgetProvider   2×1  "Workouts" one number: everything logged
 *   RoutineWidgetProvider  2×1  "Today"    today's session, or the rest day
 *
 * `HomeWidgetProvider` and `WeekWidgetProvider` keep their class names on
 * purpose: widgets already pinned to a home screen are bound to those
 * components and would otherwise vanish. What they draw has changed; what
 * Android calls them has not.
 *
 * THE CALENDAR. A real month — its name, the weekday letters, its own numbers.
 * The four-week bar strip this replaced drew marks nobody could date. A month
 * has four, five or six week rows depending on the weekday it starts on, and
 * RemoteViews cannot add a row, so the layout always holds six and the provider
 * hides the ones the month does not use.

 * The month: its name, the weekday letters, and six rows of dates.
 *
 * Shared verbatim by the 2×2 and the 4×2 — same ids, same provider code, only
 * the type sizes differ. Two layouts defining the same id is allowed and is
 * what lets one `renderCalendar` fill either card.
 *
 * The rows are weighted so a launcher's leftover height spreads across them
 * rather than pooling under the last one, and each date spans its whole column
 * so the pill behind it lines up with its neighbours. The gap between pills is
 * the column's padding, not the date's width: a `wrap_content` date inside a
 * padded column had barely 13dp to sit in, and Android's answer to a number
 * that does not fit is to break it across lines.
