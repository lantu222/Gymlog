/**
 * Put the stored workout bundle aside, for the crash screen's second action.
 *
 * A render error that comes from the workout bundle (the workout in progress,
 * and beside it the numbers remembered from earlier workouts) remounts into
 * the same error forever: "Try again" re-reads the same bytes. This is the one
 * deliberate way out, and the reader asks for it (user 2026-10-03, after a
 * repeated failure).
 *
 * It never deletes. The bundle is copied to its own key first — the same
 * pattern as the database's and the bundle's corrupt-copy slots — and the live
 * rows are removed only after that write has resolved. A copy that fails
 * throws and leaves the live data exactly as it was, so the caller can say so.
 * Nothing in the app reads a copy back; they stay on the phone until Reset all
 * data (`removeWorkoutAsideCopies`) erases them.
 *
 * A copy is never written over another one that holds something. The remount
 * after a first use hydrates an empty bundle and the provider saves it, so the
 * live key is "there" again; a second use, after a crash from elsewhere, would
 * otherwise replace the only copy of the real workout with that empty one. An
 * empty bundle is not copied at all (and the action is not offered for one),
 * and a second non-empty bundle goes to the next numbered slot beside the
 * first. A pre-rename `@gymlog/workout/v1` that sits beside a live key is
 * copied the same way rather than deleted.
