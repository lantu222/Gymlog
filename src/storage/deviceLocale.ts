 * react-native from anything the seed pulls in makes the whole test suite
 * refuse to load.
 *
 * Four sources, tried in order, because there is no single one that answers on
 * every build. `NativeModules.I18nManager` alone is what the first attempt used
 * and it came back empty on this app: the new architecture is on, and under
 * TurboModules the NativeModules proxy is not populated for modules the JS side
 * already wraps. The wrapper's own getConstants() is.
 *
 * Every branch is wrapped. This runs before storage is read, and a throw here
 * would be a blank app rather than a wrong language.
