/**
 * A stored read, tried again when the phone refuses it.
 *
 * A locked or busy database is usually free a moment later, so a failed load
 * waits and tries again — three attempts, 400 ms and then 800 ms apart — and
 * only then reports failure, which the providers show as the storage error
 * screen rather than opening on an empty store. Both providers wrote this loop
 * out in full; a change to the policy had to be made twice and would not have
 * been.
 *
 * `isCancelled` is asked after every await: a provider that unmounted, or
 * started another attempt, must not have this one land.
