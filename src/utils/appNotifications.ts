 * the two so an unchanged plan does not re-arm a month of alarms every time the
 * app comes to the foreground — except on the first sync of each process,
 * which re-arms the lot (`planNotificationSync`).
 *
 * Permission is never assumed. If the user revoked notifications in system
 * settings, sync cancels everything instead of leaving stale alarms behind
 * pretending the feature still works.
