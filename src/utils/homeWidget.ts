/**
 * Hands the home-screen widget its contents.
 *
 * The widget is drawn by the launcher in a process that has none of the app's
 * state, so the app writes a small JSON file the widget can read on its own
 * schedule. That is the whole bridge: no native module, no broadcast, no
 * shared preferences.
 *
 * The trade-off is refresh latency. Android will not update a widget more
 * often than every 30 minutes on its own, so a change made in the app can take
 * that long to appear. The content is day-granular, so this is invisible in
 * practice — except right after a workout, and the widget does not claim
 * otherwise.
 *
 * Kotlin reads `context.filesDir/vinha-widget.json`. Keep that in step with
 * `plugins/withHomeWidget.js`.
