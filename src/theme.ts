/**
 * The Pro page's three tier skins (design: "Vinha Pro v6 — kolme tasoa").
 *
 * Deliberately NOT themed, for the same reason `PW`'s sheet gradients and the
 * `COACH` surface are not: the paywall commits to one dark treatment and the
 * tier's own colour is the thing being read. A paywall that repaints with the
 * reader's light/dark toggle would make the accent — which is the only signal
 * telling Free from Pro from Lifetime — mean something different per reader.
 *
 * `sky` are the two stops of the hero's vertical gradient, which then runs to
 * black: colour at the top, dark at the bottom. `neb` and `neb2` are the two
 * radial washes over it, and `ring` is the hairline on anything the accent
 * outlines. Values come straight from the design's own token block.
