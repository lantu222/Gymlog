/**
 * The app's one light palette.
 *
 * Until 2026-07-31 there were two: `HG` (46 files) and `HG3` (Home and the
 * bottom bar), a migration `lightTheme.ts` itself described as unfinished.
 * Two palettes meant "what is the background colour?" had two answers, which
 * makes a theme engine impossible — you cannot write one dark variant of two
 * competing light ones.
 *
 * They are now the same object. Where they disagreed, HG3's cooler and
 * higher-contrast values won (user decision 2026-07-31): it was the newer,
 * deliberate direction and it dresses the most-looked-at screen.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT themed: the `PW` sheet gradients are designed dark surfaces,
 * not light-theme variants — the contrast is what marks the paid features. They
 * stay fixed in both modes. The AI Coach once had a fixed dark palette of its
 * own; its chat followed the theme first, and the full-analysis screen, the
 * last to wear it, followed on 2026-09-13.
