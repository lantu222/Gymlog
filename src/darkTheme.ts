/**
 * The app's dark palette.
 *
 * It is not a mechanical inversion of `HG`. The app already had a dark visual
 * language before it had a dark theme — the AI Coach surface, the paywall
 * sheets, the exercise-info panel — and all of them are dark *violet*, not
 * neutral grey. `COACH` in particular has been on screen since 2026-07-19 and
 * the user has approved how it reads. So the values below start from COACH's
 * text and accent colours and build the missing surfaces around them, which
 * means switching to dark makes the rest of the app look like the parts that
 * were already dark rather than like a different product.
 *
 * Two token pairs carry weight beyond their names:
 *
 *   ink / surface   — these are an inverting pair. A black button is written as
 *                     `backgroundColor: theme.ink` with `color: theme.surface`,
 *                     so in dark it becomes a white button with dark text,
 *                     which is what both platform conventions do.
 *   purpleLight /
 *   purpleSoft      — in light these are pale tinted *fills* that carry dark
 *                     text. Inverting them to dark tints keeps that role; a
 *                     literal lightening would have made unreadable surfaces.
 *
 * `gold` is unchanged: it is already a dark-surface colour in COACH and reads
 * correctly on both backgrounds. The Pro sheet gradient stops are unchanged for
 * the same reason — they were always dark.
 *
 * 2026-08-10: the surfaces moved to the boost design's dark values. Two things
 * changed and both are about depth. The page went deeper and bluer, so a card
 * sitting on it reads as a card rather than as a slightly different grey. And
 * the card outline became a translucent white hairline instead of an opaque
 * violet one — on a near-black page an opaque border draws itself, while a
 * hairline lets the surface do the separating. The text ramp and the orange
 * action accent are unchanged: those were decided on their own evidence.

 * logger imported it straight from the light theme — so every field, hairline
 * and placeholder in it stayed light whatever the app was wearing. Reported
 * from the phone: the whole logged-set row glowed white on a dark screen and
 * the numbers in it were near-invisible.
 *
 * A parallel palette rather than new Theme tokens, deliberately. Mapping these
 * onto the tokens that already exist would have shifted the light theme too —
 * `ghost` is a placeholder ink at #C0B8D4, much lighter than `faint` — and the
 * report is about dark. Light stays exactly as it was; this is what dark gets.
