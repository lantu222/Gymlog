/**
 * Keep the field you are typing into on screen.
 *
 * Tap the fourth exercise's weight in a free workout and the keyboard covers
 * it: nothing scrolls, and you are typing into a box you cannot see ("alempaa
 * ei pysty kirjaamaan vakava bugi siis", #bugs 2026-08-28).
 *
 * The manifest sets `adjustResize`, so the obvious reading is that the window
 * shrinks and only the scroll offset is stale. It does not. Under edge-to-edge
 * the window keeps its full height and the keyboard is drawn over it — proved
 * on the emulator by asking the scroll view to jump to the bottom on focus and
 * watching it refuse, because the list was already at its maximum offset. That
 * is the whole bug: there is no room below the last row to scroll into.
 *
 * So this does two things, and needs both:
 *
 *   1. Reports the keyboard's height, which the caller adds as bottom padding.
 *      Without it the scroll view cannot reach far enough, whatever it is told.
 *   2. Scrolls the focused field above the keyboard's top edge, once the
 *      padding from (1) is in the layout.

/**
 * Air left between the field and the keyboard.
 *
 * Not decoration, and not just taste. `endCoordinates.screenY` reports the
 * keyboard's top about a toolbar-row lower than where it is actually drawn —
 * measured on the emulator, the field landed exactly at the keyboard's visible
 * edge while the arithmetic considered it clear. A gap of roughly one row
 * absorbs that and is what you want anyway: a field flush against the keyboard
 * is technically visible and horrible to type into.
