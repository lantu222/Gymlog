 * What the coach and paywall screens are opened with: the demo trial's end

 *
 * Moved verbatim from VinhaApp in App.tsx in the phase-C split (2026-10-01).
 * A hook because two of the three are memos. VinhaApp calls this exactly
 * where the lines stood — after useCoachAdviceMemory, just ahead of
 * useRoutineBlockCosts — so every hook keeps its slot and every reader in
 * App.tsx still sits below the values it reads.
