/**
 * The coach's long memory: read once at startup and merged with whatever was
 * recorded before the read landed, erased with everything else on a reset,
 * and added to one answer at a time.
 *
 * Moved verbatim from VinhaApp in App.tsx in the phase-B split (2026-09-30),
 * as one block in its original byte order — the "Remember one answer" doc
 * still sits above the reset's doc, where it stood, rather than being moved
 * to the recorder it describes. A hook, not a helper: the load is an effect
 * with the shell's lifetime and the two handlers are callbacks whose identity
 * the screens receive. VinhaApp calls this exactly where the lines stood —
 * after coachDemoQuestion, before premiumTrialEndsAt — so every hook keeps its
 * slot and the load still registers in the same place among the shell's
 * effects.
 *
 * The memory and the coach thread stay VinhaApp state: a restore writes them
 * too. In the moved comments below, "this component" is VinhaApp.
