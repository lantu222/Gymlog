/**
 * The onboarding funnel's two events: `onboarding_step`, the stage a reader
 * reached, and `paywall_viewed`, once per visit and only for a reader the
 * paywall is for. The comments below carry the history of each.
 *
 * Moved out of App.tsx verbatim in the phase-B split (2026-09-30). A hook
 * because the moved code is two effects and the paywall's visit ref: VinhaApp
 * calls it at the slot they stood in — after the onboardingStep state, before
 * busySavingReadyPick and the onboarding-reset effect — so React's hook order
 * and the order the effects run in are unchanged.
