/**
 * The shell's calendar summaries: Home's, the lifetime one, and Progress's
 * training rhythm — each read off the clock, so each keyed on the day.
 *
 * Moved verbatim from VinhaApp in App.tsx in the phase-B split (2026-09-30).
 * A hook, not a helper: these are memos, and the identity they keep between
 * renders is what the dependency lists downstream in App.tsx rely on.
 * VinhaApp calls this exactly where the lines stood — after the hand-off's
 * legal-page back effect, just ahead of useProInsights — so every hook keeps
 * its slot and every reader in App.tsx still sits below the values it reads.
 *
 * In the moved comment below, "here" means these memos, as it did in App.tsx.

   * coach open with last week's "3 sessions this week", and on the 1st
   * Progress drew last month's calendar and totals beside a widget already on
   * the new one — until the next workout was logged (audit, 2026-09-20).
   *
   * The clock is read here, where the day key makes the memo re-run, rather
   * than defaulted inside each function where no dependency list can see it.
   * The moment, not the key's midnight: the thirty-day count ends at `now`,
   * and midnight would leave out everything logged today.
