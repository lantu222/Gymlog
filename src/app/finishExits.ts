/**
 * The way out of a finished workout: leaving the summary in one transition,
 * and the rating ask that leaving may raise.
 *
 * Moved verbatim from VinhaApp in App.tsx in the phase-C split (2026-10-01),
 * each function with its doc. A per-render factory, not a hook: it holds no
 * state and calls no hook. VinhaApp calls it on every render exactly where the
 * declarations stood (after resetToRoute, ahead of resolveTabRoute), so each
 * is still a fresh closure over that render's values; its one use in App.tsx,
 * the summary's onDone, sits below the call.
 *
 * In the moved doc, "every navigation helper here" means VinhaApp's navigate,
 * replaceRoute and resetToRoute in App.tsx, and "the summary branch" is the
 * summary screen's render there.
