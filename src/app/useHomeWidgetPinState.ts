/**
 * Whether Android can pin the home-screen widget and whether it is pinned,
 * re-asked on every foreground (with the app_open count that rides on the same
 * listener), and the handler that asks Android to pin it.
 *
 * Moved out of App.tsx verbatim in the phase-C split (2026-10-01). A hook
 * because the moved code is an effect: VinhaApp calls it at the slot it stood
 * in — after the lead-plan repair, before the hand-off — so React's hook order
 * and the order the effects run in are unchanged. The native module's calls
 * are passed in rather than imported, so nothing in src/app reaches for
 * ./modules directly.
