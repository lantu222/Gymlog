/**
 * Home's stat cards: the full catalogue, the reader's pinned keys, and the
 * keys the one prompt card may suggest.
 *
 * Moved verbatim from VinhaApp in App.tsx in the phase-B split (2026-09-30).
 * A hook, not a helper: two of these are memos, and the pinned keys' identity
 * is in dependency lists further down App.tsx. The suggestion stays
 * unmemoised, as it was. VinhaApp calls this exactly where the lines stood —
 * after progressWeeklyTarget — so every hook keeps its slot and every reader
 * still sits below the values it reads.
 *
 * In the moved comment below, "the props below" and "the queue" are in
 * App.tsx. The card sources stay inside; VinhaApp reads only what this
 * returns.
