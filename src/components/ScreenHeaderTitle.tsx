/**
 * The centred title in a pushed screen's header.
 *
 * It exists because the obvious version is a trap. Ten screens wrote the title
 * as an absolutely positioned `<Text>` spanning `left: 0, right: 0` with
 * `pointerEvents: 'none'` in the stylesheet — and on Android that property does
 * nothing on a Text. The title is the later sibling, so it paints over the back
 * button and swallowed every press that landed inside its band. Measured on
 * device: the back button responded only in the ~24px slivers above and below
 * the title, and the visible chevron sits dead centre, so a real tap never
 * worked. Back was unreachable on all ten screens.
 *
 * `pointerEvents` does work on a View, so the title is wrapped in one. Use this
 * component rather than re-adding a bare absolute Text — tests/screens/
 * headerBackReachable.test.cjs fails if a screen goes back to the old shape.
