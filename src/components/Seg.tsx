/**
 * The one segmented control.
 *
 * It lived inside ProgressScreen and its own comment claimed "every selector
 * in the app goes through this one component" — which was true of three of
 * them. RecordsScreen had a fourth, hand-built, with a different fill and a
 * different inner surface, so the Progress tab shipped two widgets that do the
 * same job and do not look alike. The brief calls that out by name: "Weight /
 * Reps / Volume is the same segmented control as the trend switch, so the tab
 * has one widget instead of three."
 *
 * Moved here rather than imported across screens, so the claim in the comment
 * is something a file can keep.
 *
 * Two things joined on 2026-09-09. Options may carry a glyph (an SVG path in
 * a 24-box) instead of a word, which is how the Progress tab's section tabs
 * came through here — they had a hand-built shell with a second cut surface
 * inside the selected tab, and on the phone its outline showed under the row
 * ("leikkaus on jotenkin outo"). And the dark theme's pill: dark inherited
 * light's tokens and made the selected option the dimmest thing in the row,
 * a fix the tabs had and the metric bar did not. Both have it now.
