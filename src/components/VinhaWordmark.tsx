 * The Vinha wordmark, in its two brand forms (brand package, 2026-08-19).
 *
 * Short form (default, variant D): "V·in·ha" with the middle syllable in the
 * accent. This is the in-app mark — Home's header, the onboarding title, every
 * place the reader already knows where they are.
 *
 * Full lockup (`fitness`, variant A): "Vinha Fitness" — Vinha in ink at 800,
 * Fitness in the brand purple at 700, one word-space apart, same size. The
 * official name, for the splash, the welcome screen, the store, anything that
 * introduces the app for the first time. Written as one mark so the weight
 * stays on "Vinha" and the two words cannot drift apart or be set in caps.
 *
 * The old transient "app" tag is gone with the rename: "Fitness" now does the
 * job it did — saying which Vinha this is — and it is part of the name, so it
 * stays rather than flying off.
