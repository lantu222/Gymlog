/**
 * When the coach may offer something, and when it must stop asking.
 *
 * A coach that proposes things is the point — "shall I put that measurement on
 * your home screen?" is what separates a coach from a search box. A coach that
 * proposes the same thing every conversation is a nag, and the reader learns to
 * ignore the button.
 *
 * So a refusal is treated as an answer, not as a "later": the first no buys a
 * month of silence, the second one buys silence for good. Accepting also ends
 * it — the thing is now on, and offering to turn on what is already on is the
 * sign that explains a sign.
