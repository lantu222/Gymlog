/**
 * Reading a training programme out of a photo.
 *
 * The reader keeps their programme in a Google spreadsheet and photographs it
 * or screenshots it. On-device OCR was the obvious route and is the wrong one:
 * it reads characters, not meaning, and a spreadsheet with merged cells, a
 * header row and a "day" column that only fills on the first row of each block
 * defeats it. The model already behind AI Coach reads the *table*.
 *
 * The trick that makes this small: the model returns the same four columns the
 * CSV importer already parses, so a photo becomes CSV text and everything
 * downstream — the preview, the unmatched-row correction, the name book — is
 * the code that already exists. Nothing here imports anything; it produces the
 * text the existing parser eats.
 *
 * Shared by the app and `api/ai-coach.ts`, so the schema the model is held to
 * and the validation the answer passes through cannot drift apart.
