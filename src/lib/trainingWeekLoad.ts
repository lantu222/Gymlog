/**
 * How much of a week a rhythm actually asks for.
 *
 * The programme screen used to answer this with `program.sessions.length` —
 * how many DIFFERENT sessions the programme holds, which is only the same
 * number as "days per week" when the rhythm happens to run one of each every
 * seven days. Set a five-session programme to "4 on · 1 off" and it trains six
 * days some weeks; the header went on saying five (user 2026-08-31).
 *
 * Three sources, in order of who knows better:
 *   1. a cycle, which states its own period and is not tied to weekdays;
 *   2. the days the plan names, which is the truth for a weekday rhythm;
 *   3. the programme's own stated days, for a programme nobody has adopted.
 *
 * The third used to be the SESSION count, which is a different number: a
 * rolling programme spreads its sessions over its days, and Strength
 * Foundations 5x5 runs two workouts across three days. Counting sessions drew
 * it as a two-day programme under a catalog row that said "3 ×" (#bugs
 * 2026-09-01).
