/**
 * What the reader has learned, and what they have checked off.
 *
 * Two separate answers, deliberately. `learned` is a declaration — the reader
 * pressed a button that says they know the lift. The technique check is a
 * self-audit: four statements about the set they just did, where the ones they
 * cannot tick are the ones worth filming. Deriving either from the other would
 * put words in their mouth, so nothing here does.
 *
 * Pure, because `src/storage/database.ts` normalises on load and that file
 * cannot be imported in a test (it reaches AsyncStorage, which reaches React
 * Native). The rule the loader enforces has to live somewhere a test can call.
