 * caller passes it on its first sync in each process (native audit,
 * 2026-09-21). The pending list is expo-notifications' own record, not the
 * OS's alarms: a force-stop, or revoking exact alarms, drops every alarm
 * while the record keeps listing them, and the library re-arms that record
 * only on boot or an app update. Diffing against it alone left an unchanged
 * plan "pending" and silent for good. At most MAX_SCHEDULED (48) requests,
 * once per process start; every later sync in the process diffs, so a
 * foreground does not re-arm a month of alarms for nothing.
 *
 * `allowed` false (no OS permission) or an empty plan cancels everything
 * rather than keep alarms that can no longer be delivered.

/**
 * Whether this sync re-arms everything rather than diffs.
 *
 * Every first sync of a process does (see `planNotificationSync`). And so
 * does one where Android's exact-alarm answer has changed since the plan was
 * last armed: expo-notifications picks exact or inexact at the moment it
 * arms, so a plan armed while the grant was missing stays inexact — up to an
 * hour late — after the reader allows "Alarms & reminders", for as long as
 * the process lives. Measured on an Android 14 emulator (2026-09-30): the
 * grant does not restart the app, and a foreground left the reminder at
 * `window=+1h`. A revoke needs no rule of its own — Android kills the
 * process, and the next one re-arms.
 *
 * `null` is "this build cannot tell": no change is assumed from it.
