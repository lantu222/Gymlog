/**
 * Whether "ramp a ramp" (2026-09-09) is visible in a set summary, or hidden
 * behind one number.
 *
 * Each set's opening weight is deliberately carried from the SAME set index
 * last time (workoutState.ts resolveHistoricalSetDraft / findHistoricalSetForIndex),
 * so a ramp stays a ramp across sessions. But every summary on the guided
 * player collapsed that to one weight: the set card's "LAST TIME" header
 * showed only the heaviest set with rep-only chips, and the walk-up card's
 * NYT/VIIMEKSI showed set 1's planned load and the heaviest logged one. A
 * real case (#bugs 2026-09-29): last time's Lantionnosto laitteessa went
 * 16,25×8, 16,25×8, 30×6, 30×6, 30×6 — the header said "30 kg · 8 8 6 6 6",
 * sets 1-2 opened at 16,25 and set 3 "suddenly" opened at 30 with nothing on
 * screen explaining why.
 *
 * The owner's call (decision "a", 2026-09-29): keep the per-set replay, and
 * make it visible instead of smoothing it away. A uniform set keeps today's
 * exact look — one weight, plain rep chips — so nothing changes for the
 * common case.
