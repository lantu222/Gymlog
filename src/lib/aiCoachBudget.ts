/**
 * Spend controls for the coach endpoint (execution-plan A2).
 *
 * What this can and cannot do, stated plainly, because the difference matters:
 *
 * The endpoint is a stateless serverless function. Nothing here survives a
 * cold start, so an in-process counter is a brake, not a ceiling — a burst
 * spread across fresh instances slips past it. The only true ceiling is the
 * spend limit set on the Anthropic Console, which is a manual step and is
 * documented as such in docs/ai-coach-backend.md.
 *
 * What IS enforceable per request, and is enforced here:
 *
 * - A bound on how large a single call can get. This is the real lever: the
 *   response is already capped by max_tokens, but the request carries eight
 *   weeks of training history, and a client can post whatever it likes. An
 *   unbounded prompt is an unbounded bill.
 * - A per-instance budget in tokens, so the brake is denominated in the thing
 *   that actually costs money rather than in request count. Ten enormous
 *   requests should exhaust it faster than ten small ones.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so it can be tested without a network or a clock.
