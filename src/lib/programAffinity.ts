/**
 * Recommendations that follow the program you actually chose.
 *
 * The old "For you" row had one source: the onboarding questionnaire. Skip the
 * questionnaire, or pick a ready program straight off the catalog, and the row
 * was empty forever — which is most people, because the reader had already told
 * us what they want by choosing a program. Choosing STRONG Starter is a
 * statement of intent every bit as strong as answering "strength" in a form,
 * and it is more recent.
 *
 * So this reads the active program and finds neighbours in the catalog. Every
 * suggestion carries the reason it is a neighbour, and the reason is derived
 * from fields the template really declares — goal, level, days per week — not
 * written per program by hand. A recommendation that cannot say why it is here
 * does not belong in the row.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT labelled AI. `aiInfo.never.2` says the model is never used
 * to pick a programme, and it is not: this is four comparisons and a sort.
