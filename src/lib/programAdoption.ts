/**
 * Adopting a ready program as the reader's active plan.
 *
 * Until now the only code that ever set `preferences.activePlanId` lived in the
 * two onboarding finishes. Everything after onboarding could start a *session*
 * from a ready program, but nothing could make that program the plan Home reads
 * — so "Start season" on SeasonScreen opened the season's programme page and
 * stopped there, and a reader who had not happened to pick that exact programme
 * during onboarding could never join a season at all. Since season points only
 * count sessions from the season programme, the whole scoreboard was
 * unreachable.
 *
 * This module is the missing step, kept pure so the rule is testable: it builds
 * the plan record that makes adoption true. Whether adoption is allowed at all
 * is activeProgramSet's question.
 *
 * The same gap existed on the other side and outlived the fix here: a program
 * the reader had built or imported themselves could be opened and its sessions
 * could be started, but nothing made it the plan Home reads. Reported by a
 * reader who imported their own six-day program and could not get it onto the
 * home screen by any route. Nothing here was ever ready-specific except the id,
 * so both sources now build their plan the same way.
