 * Moving a programme's emphasis (design: GAINER Hourglass Shape, screen 3).

 * The design's rule, and the reason the controls are linked: a week holds a
 * finite number of sets, so raising one area lowers the others. The total is
 * preserved by construction here rather than checked afterwards — a slider
 * that could quietly grow the week from 77 sets to 96 would be selling more
 * training as a preference.
 *
 * Steppers rather than sliders at the call site: the design's own script
 * quantises a drag to whole four-set jumps, and a stepper expresses exactly
 * that with no gesture imprecision — which also happens to be the only option
 * without a slider dependency.
