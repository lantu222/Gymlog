/**
 * Which ONE prompt card Home may show (design: Sheets & Pickers, frame 15).
 *
 * Home had grown a stack: the sign-in card, the measurement suggestion and
 * the card grid could all render at once — three asks piled on the screen
 * whose job is running today's session (seen stacked on a device,
 * 2026-08-30). The rule is now one card at a time, and the queue is decided
 * here so the order is testable rather than an accident of JSX order.
 *
 * Two decisions carried from the design's own notes:
 *
 * - The sign-in card waits until the THIRD logged session. A fresh install
 *   has nothing worth backing up, and asking for an account before the app
 *   has proven anything is the ask most likely to be both refused and
 *   remembered. Three sessions is also when a lost phone starts costing
 *   something real.
 * - Sign-in outranks the suggestion when both are due: it guards data that
 *   already exists, and it leaves the queue for good once answered, so the
 *   suggestion's turn always comes.
