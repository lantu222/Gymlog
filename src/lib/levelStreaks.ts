/**
 * Level tiers for the onboarding level step's motion field.

/**
 * The onboarding level step's field, in the same bar language as the launch.
 *
 * This replaced a ring of flame emoji around the wordmark. The bars say the
 * same thing the app's name does — *vinha* means fast — and they can say it in
 * degrees, which a flame cannot: the tiers below get denser AND quicker as the
 * level rises (2 bars at ~1.5 s, 4 at ~1.1 s, 7 at ~0.75 s over the same
 * distance), so the difference is legible at a glance and again in the
 * tempo.
 *
 * Coordinates are inside the 280 × 140 logo box, not the screen canvas, so `y`
 * is used raw here rather than through `scaleY`. Delays stay negative for the
 * same reason as `DRIFT`: every bar is already mid-flight on the first paint,
 * so switching level never shows an empty box filling in.
