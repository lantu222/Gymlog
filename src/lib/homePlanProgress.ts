 * plan sessions logged Monday to Sunday. Home counts both from the block, and
 * a block only starts on a Monday when the plan did. A plan taken up on a
 * Thursday, three days a week: Monday's session — the third, which finished
 * week 1 — read "WEEK 1 · 1/3" while Home said week 1 was done, and Friday's
 * read "WEEK 2 · 3/3" with week 2 two sessions in (audit, 2026-09-20). Every
 * plan not started on a Monday. Both numbers are the block's now, the same
 * arithmetic as Home's hero.
 *
 * `sessionsDone` includes the session the pill is about. Before the save that
 * is one more than the log holds; after it, the log already has it — so the
 * finish view and the summary ask with different counts and get the same
 * week for the same session. A finished block holds its last week full
 * rather than counting past it.
