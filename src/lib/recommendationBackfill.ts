/**
 * Keeping "Sinulle" honest after you act on it.
 *
 * The row came from the questionnaire and never moved again: adopt the
 * programme it recommended and it kept recommending it, next to a card saying
 * "valittu sinulle" for something you were already running. Two slots, one of
 * them permanently spent.
 *
 * So a programme you have taken leaves the row, and the gap is filled from the
 * catalog — measured from what you are running NOW rather than from what you
 * answered in a form months ago. resolveProgramAffinity ranks its reasons, and
 * "same goal, one level up" is the first of them, so the replacement is
 * usually a step up. Usually, not always: if the catalog has no harder
 * programme for that goal it offers a different split rather than inventing a
 * level, because "haastavampi" has to be true of the programme and not just of
 * the label on the card.
 *
 * Nothing here is a score and nothing is random. Same inputs, same row.
