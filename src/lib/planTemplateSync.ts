/**
 * The plan's week, brought back into step with the template's days.
 *
 * A custom programme is two records: the template holds the days and their
 * lifts, and the plan holds which weekday each day sits on and which one comes
 * next. Every writer that changes the days has had to move both — adoption
 * builds them together, a rename repoints the plan's name, a drag re-deals its
 * sessions. The template editor changed only the template.
 *
 * So adding a day to a running programme left the plan with the old count: the
 * new day was never offered on Home, never on the week strip, never the next
 * session. Removing one left an entry pointing at a session that no longer
 * existed — Home filtered it out of the list it renders and went on quoting
 * `entries.length` for "3 day plan" and for the weekly minutes, and because
 * the surviving rows were then read by their position in the FILTERED list
 * against the UNFILTERED entries, every day after the gap wore the previous
 * day's weekday (audit 3, 2026-09-19).
 *
 * `repointPlanEntrySessions` deliberately refuses this case — it skips on a
 * count mismatch, because a drag must never invent or drop a training day.
 * Here the count is exactly what changed, so it is the thing to follow.
