/**
 * Moving a whole day inside a programme.
 *
 * The exercises inside a day have been draggable since the frame-05 round;
 * the days themselves were fixed in the order they were created (user
 * 2026-08-31: "voi järjestystä vaihtaa miten haluaa — tee identtinen systeemi
 * kun siellä missä treenejä voi vaihtaa"). Same contract as that one: the drop
 * is ONE write, the destination is clamped rather than refused, and a move
 * that changes nothing is not a write at all.
 *
 * This matters more than reordering lifts does. The rotation reads the session
 * list positionally — slot 0 is the first session — so moving a day changes
 * which day of the week each session lands on. That is the point, but it is
 * also why a no-op must not be saved: rewriting the template would re-stamp
 * every orderIndex for a list that looks exactly as it did.
