/**
 * What the app remembers about warming up your own way.
 *
 * One number: how long the last one took. The free timer counts up because the
 * app does not know how long your warm-up takes, and that is the only figure
 * which makes an open-ended clock readable — 2:14 means nothing on its own and
 * quite a lot next to "last time you took 4:20".
 *
 * It also kept a count, which fed an offer to always skip the guided drills
 * after the third session run that way. The offer was removed on 2026-09-04
 * (user), and the count went with it: a stored number with no reader is the
 * next person's puzzle.
