/**
 * Anonymous usage events — the answer to "is some step so hard that people
 * quit there" (user, 2026-08-25).
 *
 * The design constraint is the app's own privacy stance: Vinha's pitch is
 * that data stays on the phone. So this collects the minimum that answers
 * real questions and nothing more:
 *
 *  - a random install id, generated on the device, tied to nothing — not the
 *    account, not the email, not the advertising id
 *  - WHICH screen-level steps happened and when — never what was in them:
 *    no exercise names, no weights, no measurements, no question texts
 *
 * The allowlist below is the entire vocabulary. The client refuses to queue
 * anything outside it and the server refuses to store it, so a future call
 * site cannot quietly start shipping something new: widening the vocabulary
 * is a visible edit here, which is exactly where a privacy reviewer looks.
 * An event that answers no question is noise — the same rule as the labels.
