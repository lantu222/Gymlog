/**
 * An interval exercise's own rhythm, read from its name.
 *
 * "Treadmill HIIT (30s on / 30s off)" is not eight sets of thirty repetitions
 * with a rest in between — it is thirty seconds of running and thirty of
 * walking, over and over, and the walk IS the recovery (user, 2026-08-26:
 * "eikö se tarkoita että treeni pitää sisällään 30s kävelyä/30s juoksua").
 * The player has to run both halves on a clock, because a work phase with no
 * timer is a work phase the reader has to guess at while running.
 *
 * The name is the source. Every catalog interval states its scheme in
 * brackets, a saved programme carries the same name, and a name cannot drift
 * out of sync with itself the way a separate seconds field can.
