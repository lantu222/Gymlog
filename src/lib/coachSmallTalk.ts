/**
 * "Kiitos" is not a coaching question.
 *
 * The transcript review on 2026-08-23 found a thank-you answered with a full
 * analysis, a plan and three next steps — the forced tool shape has no way to
 * simply acknowledge something. Worse, it cost one of three free questions a
 * week to say you are welcome.
 *
 * So the chat answers these itself: no request leaves the device, nothing is
 * charged, and the reply comes from the list below.
 *
 * The matching is deliberately narrow, because the two mistakes are not
 * equally bad. Missing one costs a needless API call. A false positive answers
 * a real question with "ole hyvä" — which reads as the coach ignoring you. So
 * the whole message must be small talk: no digits, no question mark, at most
 * four words, and every one of them from the vocabulary.
