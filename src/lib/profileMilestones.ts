 * Twelve families, each a ladder of round numbers the reader climbs by
 * training. Every rung is derived from what is already in the log — no new
 * storage, no new query. A rung is reached the moment the figure passes it,
 * and the family's next rung takes its place on the card; the reached ones
 * are kept on their own page with the day they fell. The copy is
 * descriptive, never promissory: the numbers are what the reader did,
 * phrased as a distance.
 *
 * Tiers are a coarse read of how far into a family a rung sits. They are
 * labels for the page, not a mechanic: nothing unlocks, nothing is hidden.
