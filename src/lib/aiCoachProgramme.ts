 *
 * The context used to carry one line — `custom: Pakarakunto · Pro | 57 ready
 * programs available` — so the coach could name the programme and nothing
 * else. Asked what was in it, it answered "I cannot see your programme's
 * exercises in this data": honest about the payload, and nonsense to a reader
 * whose next tap shows every exercise (user 2026-08-25). It also made every
 * "does this fit my goal" question unanswerable, because judging a programme
 * without reading it is the one thing the evidence rules forbid.
 *
 * The source is Home's own composed week, so the coach reads the same rows the
 * reader does. Nothing is recomputed here; a second derivation is a second
 * chance to disagree with the screen.
