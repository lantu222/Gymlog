/**
 * Supersets, as one idea shared by every list of exercises in the app.
 *
 * A superset is two or more lifts done back to back with no rest between
 * them. The app had no notion of pairing at all — the word appeared six times
 * in the tree and every one of them was something else, a lift whose NAME is
 * "Lateral Raise Superset" and Hevy's `superset_id` column the import skips.
 * So this is not a screen behaviour: the programme day, the guided player and
 * the free workout each hold a list of exercises, and unless all three read
 * the same rule the app ends up with two different ideas of what a superset
 * is — and the programme side is where people actually train.
 *
 * The rule, in one sentence: a group is a run of ADJACENT exercises sharing
 * one group id, and rest belongs after the run, not inside it.
 *
 * Adjacency is what makes the concept survive everything else the lists do.
 * A row can be reordered, removed, swapped or skipped by code that knows
 * nothing about supersets; if the pairing were a free-floating id, those
 * edits would leave a pair whose halves sit five rows apart, and every
 * consumer would have to decide separately what that means. Here it means
 * nothing: `normalizeSupersetGroups` is run on load and after every edit, and
 * a group that is no longer adjacent is no longer a group.
