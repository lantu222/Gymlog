/**
 * Where the diagonal seam runs on "Your programme is ready".
 *
 * Two programmes share the screen, split by a slanted seam; the chosen one
 * swells and the other collapses to its name. The seam used to sit at fixed
 * fractions of the height, and the chosen card grew: the week strip moved
 * into it (2026-09-07/09), so a chosen LOWER card — bottom-anchored in a box
 * that fraction had sized — overflowed upward past the seam, and its name
 * ended up behind the upper half (device, 2026-09-16). On a shorter screen the
 * collapsed half's name had the same problem from the other side.
 *
 * So the fractions are where the seam would like to be, and the measured
 * content decides where it can be. The collapsed programme's name is kept
 * first — it is two lines at most, and a programme you cannot read is a
 * programme you cannot choose — and the chosen card gets everything else.
