 * What a square in the activity calendar means.
 *
 * `missed` is only ever claimed about a day that has already passed and was
 * genuinely a planned training day. A rest day without a session is just rest,
 * and a training day still ahead is upcoming, not a failure — the calendar
 * should never invent a streak the user broke.
 *
 * The plan's rhythm comes in as a TrainingSchedule, the same shape Home and
 * the widget read, so a two-on-one-off cycle marks the same days here as it
 * does everywhere else. A weekday list could not say that (2026-08-25).
