/**
 * Colour, motif and goal line by program FAMILY (design: GAINER Ready Catalog
 * v2 — "tone comes from the program family").
 *
 * The catalog's programs are named as family + level — HOME Starter, STRONG
 * Pro, HUGE Elite — so the family is the first word of the presentation title.
 * Every member of a family wears the same tone, which is what makes the shelf
 * readable at a glance: all the purple cards are strength, all the blue ones
 * are size.
 *
 * Relationship to `programVisualIdentity.ts`: that module picks one of five
 * styles by hashing the template id, so a family's members scatter across five
 * colours and a motif can land on an unrelated program (the barbell currently
 * rides HUGE's blue, the layers ride STRONG's violet). The palette here is the
 * SAME palette — these hex pairs are the design's `oklch(0.70 0.15 h)` and
 * `oklch(0.46 0.19 h)` evaluated per family hue, and five of them come out
 * identical to the five existing styles. What changes is the assignment: by
 * family rather than by hash, and motif locked to the family that owns it.
 *
 * React Native has neither `oklch()` nor CSS gradients, so the stops are
 * precomputed here and painted with an SVG LinearGradient.
