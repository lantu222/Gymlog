/**
 * The app once launched to a blank screen and stayed there.
 *
 * VinhaSplashScreen held `reduceMotion: boolean | null`, rendered an empty
 * field while it was null, and started the animation — the thing that
 * eventually calls onDone — only once it was not. App.tsx renders nothing but
 * that screen until onDone fires. So a single
 * `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` that never settled, on a real
 * Galaxy A54, was an app that could not be started, with nothing in logcat
 * because nothing threw.
 *
 * These guard the shape of the fix rather than one call site: the query is
 * asked through a helper that cannot fail to answer, and no screen goes back
 * to asking the platform directly.
