 * Two screens nothing could open — audit round 3, 2026-09-20.
 *
 * `AICoachScreen` was reachable only from itself: the one place that built a
 * `screen: 'ai'` route was `handleOpenAICoach`, and the only thing holding
 * `handleOpenAICoach` was that screen's own `onSubmitPrompt`. A door whose
 * only key is on the inside.
 *
 * `WorkoutEditorScreen` hung off it: the one place that built a
 * `screen: 'editor'` route was the `open_custom_editor` branch of
 * `handleSelectAiCoachAction`, which only that screen could reach. 1 286 lines
 * of editor behind a door behind the first door.
 *
 * This guard is about the shape, not the files: what made them dead was that
 * a route existed with no way in. Re-adding either screen is fine — wiring one
 * to nothing is what must not come back.

     * The rule the deletion came from, kept as a rule — and kept honestly.
     *
     * The first version of this guard asked "does the string `screen: 'x'`
     * appear anywhere?", which is not the same question at all. Run that
     * version against the tree before this commit and it reports nothing
     * wrong with `ai` or `editor`: `App.tsx` *did* contain
     * `navigate({ tab: 'home', screen: 'ai', prompt })` — inside
     * `handleOpenAICoach`, a function wired to nothing but the dead screen
     * itself. The guard would have passed the very bug it is named after
     * (CI review of #150).
     *
     * So it walks the graph instead. A route is reachable when something
     * that can actually run builds it:
     *
     *   seeds        the four tab roots plus the plans route, which the
     *                bottom bar reaches from anywhere
     *   renders      `route.screen === 'x'` next to a JSX tag says which
     *                component that route puts on screen
     *   builds       a `{ tab, screen }` construction, and the top-level
     *                function it sits inside
     *   attached     a handler named as a JSX prop belongs to that component
     *
     * Then: a route is reachable if one of its constructions sits in a
     * handler attached to a component that some already-reachable route
     * renders. Repeat until nothing new is added.
     *
     * Defaults to reachable. A construction with no enclosing handler, or a
     * handler nothing attaches to a component, counts — so the check only
     * ever accuses a route it can SEE is built solely by handlers living on
     * screens that are themselves out of reach. That is the shape of this
     * PR's bug, and it is the shape it is worth failing over.
     *
     * Checked against b7932fc, the commit before this one: it names
     * `home/ai`, `workout/editor` and `workout/celebration` there, and only
     * `workout/season` here.
