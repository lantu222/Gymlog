/**
 * Back on the workout summary leaves the way Done does (#bugs 2026-10-02).
 *
 * Done clears the summary and moves the route in ONE transition and resets the
 * history. Hardware Back cleared the summary urgently and popped the history in
 * a transition: a frame showed the summary route with its data gone, the pop
 * landed on whatever the history held (the finished workout's own player), and
 * useFinishRouteGuard raced it to Home keeping that history. The shell's
 * pieces need React Native, so this guards the source the way the neighbouring
 * screen suites do.
