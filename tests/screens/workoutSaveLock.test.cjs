/**
 * The guided player takes no input while Finish saves (bug hunt 2026-10-03, never-list N1).
 *
 * handleConfirmFinishWorkout adapts the session before its await. The exit sheet's "Finish & save"
 * closed the sheet and left the player on the set step, so a set ticked while the save was in
 * flight reached the reducer and the slot history, was not in the saved workout, and went with the
 * finished session when it was cleared. The free workout board already refuses edits during its
 * Finish (EmptyWorkoutScreen's finishingRef); the guided player gets the same rule as a layer over
 * the whole screen, which is released when the save fails so the save-failed panel and its retry
 * stay reachable.
 *
 * A source test: the lock is a render, and there is no React renderer in this suite. The reducer
 * itself takes any action it is sent, by design (the player is the only thing that sends them), so
 * the lock cannot live there without a `finishing` state the persisted bundle would then carry.
