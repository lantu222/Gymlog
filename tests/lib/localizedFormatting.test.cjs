 * other screen uses. A weight printed as "92.5 kg" to a Finnish reader, the
 * same weight hidden inside an i18n variable where the call site looks
 * correct, and an exercise called "Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip" two taps
 * from a screen calling it "Penkkipunnerrus".
 *
 * A sweep found twenty-two more. These guards exist so there is no
 * twenty-third: the interesting half of that class is invisible at the call
 * site, which is exactly the kind of thing a person cannot be asked to
