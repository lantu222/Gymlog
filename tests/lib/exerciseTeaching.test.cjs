/**
 * The teaching layer, kept honest against the library it points at.
 *
 * The failure this suite exists for has happened in this repo before: the
 * programme composer wrote exercise names by hand under a comment claiming
 * they were "grounded in catalog exercise names", and 39% of composed weeks
 * contained lifts that were not lifts. Teaching content has the same shape —
 * hand-written strings naming other exercises — so it gets the same sweep.
 *
 * My first pass produced two of exactly those errors: a "harder" swap on the
 * bench press that pointed at the bench press, and a deadlift swap naming
 * "Barbell Deficit Deadlift", which the library calls "Deficit Deadlift".
