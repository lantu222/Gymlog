 * The catalog card every ready program shows: a name, one line, three chips.

 * Written after 43 of the 57 programs turned out to have no card of their own.
 * Nothing was broken — `getReadyTemplatePresentation` has a fallback, and the
 * fallback is what made the omission invisible: it takes the template's internal
 * name (English) and the program's whole description paragraph, so those cards
 * were three times the height of the others and their chips were guessed from
 * the data rather than chosen.
 *
 * That is what this file makes impossible to repeat. A new ready program with
 * no card fails here rather than shipping a card that looks almost right.
