/**
 * The programme onboarding saves has to read the same after a relaunch.
 *
 * Saved programmes prescribe one rep number (user 2026-08-26), and
 * `normalizeDatabase` enforces it on every load with `collapseRepRange`. The
 * composer's two invented doses — the focus accessory and the suggested day's
 * lift — still wrote "10–15". So onboarding previewed "2 × 10–15", the next
 * launch read "2 × 15", and the stored bytes caught up at the first full
 * save, which is finishing a workout: every one of those rows, trained that
 * day or not, went from 10/15 to 15/15 in `@vinha/database/v1` (emulator,
 * 2026-09-13). It looked like progression rewriting the programme. It was the
 * loader applying a rule the composer had not.
 *
 * The oracle is the loader's own function: whatever onboarding saves must be a
 * fixed point of it, so a save can never change what the reader was shown.
