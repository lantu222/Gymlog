 * Recheck round, 2026-09-29: App.tsx's onRestored erased the coach's own
 * memory fire-and-forget — `void clearCoachAdviceMemory()` — so
 * useAccountBackup's applyRestore (which never awaited it either) could
 * resolve the restore before the erase had even reached the disk. A process
 * kill in that window left another account's coach memory behind for the
 * next one. Source guard, the same convention as the rest of this app's
 * wiring tests: the handler is a plain object literal passed into a hook,
 * not something a runtime harness can drive without also driving the whole
 * hook it configures.
