 * It was the fourth batch of round 3 in miniature (three screens nothing could
 * open, 3 150 lines behind them), found the same way: by asking who reaches a
 * file rather than whether it reads well (2026-09-20).
 *
 * What counts as reaching: an import from src/ (any layer, lib included),
 * App.tsx, api/, scripts/ or modules/. A test alone does not — a module that
 * exists to pass its own test is the dead code the test keeps warm.
 *
 * PARKED is the list of modules kept on purpose with nothing wired to them
 * yet. Each entry names why; the guard fails if a parked module gains an
 * importer (take it off the list) or loses its file (same).
