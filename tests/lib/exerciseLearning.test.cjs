 * is a source-reading suite about what ExerciseDetailScreen renders — a
 * different question, and the wrong directory. Flagged by the PR review on
 * #40 against CLAUDE.md: "New domain logic belongs in `src/lib/` as a pure
 * function, covered by a test in `tests/lib/`." Every sibling module added in
 * this PR had its own file there; this one was the outlier.
 *
 * Moved rather than rewritten. The assertions were already driving the real
 * functions, so what was wrong was where they lived, not what they said.
