 * English display names: the same lift, said the way a gym says it.

 * The library ships from a public database that is pedantic where a gym is
 * not — "Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip" is the bench press. Only the label
 * moves; the English name stays the id that everything matches and swaps on.
 *
 * The one real danger is a rename that lands on a DIFFERENT lift, which is
 * why this file exists and why the table was hand-written instead of inverted
 * out of GUIDED_LIBRARY_ALIASES: that table deliberately maps a catalog name
 * onto the nearest library row it can train with, so inverting it would have
 * relabelled Hanging Leg Raise as "hanging knee raise".
