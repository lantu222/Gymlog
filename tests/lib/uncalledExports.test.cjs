/**
 * Nothing in src/lib may be written, tested and never wired up.
 *
 * This happened three times in one day. `weeklyTrainingStreak` computed the
 * streak the calendar is about and had no caller. `getProgramFocusQualityLabel`
 * existed while the screen printed the raw English identifier next to it.
 * `buildFirstRunCustomProgramName` takes a language that the caller never
 * passed, so Vinha named the program it builds for you in English on a Finnish
 * home screen. Each was found by looking at the phone, not by the suite: a
 * green test proves the function works, never that anything calls it.
 *
 * So the suite checks the wiring. Every exported name in src/lib must be
 * referenced somewhere outside its own module and outside tests — or be listed
 * below with the reason it is not.
