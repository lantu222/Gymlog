/**
 * database.ts imports AsyncStorage, so it cannot be required in Node and the
 * loader has to be read rather than run.
 *
 * That is exactly why this file no longer holds the RULE. Its first version
 * asserted the shape of an inlined ternary — including `defaultRestSeconds > 0`,
 * the very comparison that was in the wrong place — and went green over the
 * hole the PR reviewer later found. A source guard can only check that the
 * loader delegates; what the rule decides is tested for real in
 * tests/lib/restPreference.test.cjs, against a function Node can call.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: "Loaders that trust stored data. src/storage/database.ts
 * normalizes on load; a new field that skips it is a crash on someone's old
 * install."
